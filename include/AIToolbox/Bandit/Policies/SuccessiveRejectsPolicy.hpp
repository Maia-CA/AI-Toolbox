     * @brief This class implements the successive rejects algorithm.
     *
     * The successive rejects (SR) algorithm is a budget-based pure exploration
     * algorithm. Its goal is to simply recommend the best possible action
     * after its budget of pulls has been exhausted. The reward accumulated
     * during the exploration phase is irrelevant to the algorithm itself,
     * which is only focused on optimizing the quality of the final
     * recommendation.
     *
     * The way SR works is to split the available budget into phases. During
     * each phase, each arm is pulled a certain (nKNew_ - nKOld_) number of
     * times, which depends on the current phase. After these pulls, the arm
     * with the lowest empirical mean is removed from the pool of arms to be
     * evaluated.
     *
     * The algorithm keeps removing arms from the pool until a single arm
     * remains, which corresponds to the final recommended arm.
